/**
 This function returns basic information about a device.

 @param[in]  TokenNumber        Unsigned integer that specifies the PCD token associated with a device's information.
 @param[out] DevicePath         Pointer to a returned pointer to a device path that indicates the device's device path.
                                The format of the returned device path is consistent with the format specified in the
                                UEFI specification. The device path must not be freed by the caller.
 @param[out] DeviceAttribCount  Pointer to a returned unsigned integer that indicates the number of device attributes
                                associated with the device indicated by DevicePath.

 @retval EFI_SUCCESS            Function returned successfully.
 @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER  DevicePath was NULL or DeviceAttribCount was NULL.
 @retval EFI_VOLUME_CORRUPTED   The format of the device path in the PCD was invalid.
 @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND          There is no device information associated with the specified TokenNumber.

                                Indices are numbered starting with 0 and continue until the last attribute. There are no gaps.
 @param[out] DeviceAttribName   Pointer to a returned pointer to a null-terminated ASCII string that indicates the name
                                of the device attribute associated with the device.
                                The string value must not be freed by the caller.
 @param[out] DeviceAttribValue  Pointer to a returned pointer to a null-terminated ASCII string that indicates the value
