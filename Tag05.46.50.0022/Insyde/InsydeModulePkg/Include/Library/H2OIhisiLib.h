Module Name:

  H2OIhisiLib.h

Abstract:

  This library class provides services to non-SMM drivers to access IHISI
  services.

  If the PCD PcdH2OIhisiAuthSupported is set to FALSE, then the H2OIhisiAuth,
  H2OIhisiAuthLock and H2OIhisiAuthUnlock functions will always return
  IhisiSuccess. This allows the same code flow to be used by the calling function.

  This library handles session token automatically.

/**
  This function sets the security level to the specified level. If the specified security level is not available
  , then an error is returned. If PcdH2OIhisiAuthSupported is set to FALSE, then this function will always return
  IhisiSuccess.

  @param  [in] SecurityLevelRequested   Bitmask that specifies the IHISI security level requested. Only
                                        a single bit may be specified. Valid values are:
                                        IHISI_AUTH_NONE - Minimum security level possible.

                                                              fail. The password is specified by CredentialData.
  @param  [in] CredentialData           Pointer to Handler array with has been free by caller.

  @retval IhisiSuccess                  Function completed successfully or PcdH2OIhisiAuthSupported is set to FALSE.
  @retval IhisiInvalidParamFatalError   SecurityLevelRequested specified a security level that is not supported.

  This function is a wrapper for the IHISI function FBTSOEMCapsuleSecureFlash. This function creates the structures in
  the Command Buffer. The type of reset is returned in FlashToolAction.

  @param  [in]  CapsuleSize        Unsigned integer that specifies the size of the capsule image, in bytes.
  @param  [out] FlashToolAction    Pointer to enumerated value that tells the tool what action to take after this call.
                                   Valid values are below. The default is 1 (Reboot).
                                    WINFLASH_DO_S3 - Perform S3 suspend.
