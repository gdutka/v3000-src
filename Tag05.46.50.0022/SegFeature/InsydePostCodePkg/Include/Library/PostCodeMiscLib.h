  Produces a Null-terminated ASCII string in an output buffer based on a Null-terminated

  There are three type strings will be generated. 
  The output string is specified by StringType.
    1.ScreenDisplayStr: The Post Code string which is printed on monitor

    3.ComPortStr      : The Post Code string which is sent to COM Port 

  @param [in]  StringType    The string type which will be generated.
  @param [in]  PostCode      The Post Code which will be generated into the output string.
  @param [in]  BufferSize    The size, in bytes, of the output buffer specified by Buffer.
  @param [out] Buffer        A pointer to the output buffer for the produced Null-terminated 
                             ASCII string.

  @return The number of ASCII characters in the produced output buffer not including the
          Null-terminator. If return 0, the bufferSize may be too small or the Buffer is NULL.
